**Game Guide:**

Here we have four different folders as you may see, there should be “The Big 10”, or the top 10 games I recommend from the collection, the fully local ones, which have folders with extra **necessary** files that are required for the games to function, click on the desired folder for the game, and then locate and open/double click the file titled “-CLICK THIS TO PLAY-.html” (At the Top), this will launch the game in chrome and allows you to play it. Finally, the web-based folder contains just HTML files, which access websites that host the content for the game, download it in a sort of temporary storage of this data, and then use it in Chrome. All you need to do is look at the name of the file before “.HTML” to see the game and then double-click on it.

TL;DR:

The Big 10 = Top 10 Games that I recommend.

Web Based = Only HTML files that access websites.

Fully Local = HTML files that use the content downloaded along with the archives, completely offline.

**How To Use:**

First things first, here is how to open the actual games in your [Default Browser](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23357/default-browser), this is done quite simply.

1. Locate the folder marked “The Archives V2” using the Filepaths listed above.
1. Locate what games you want to play, and use the Game Guide for the different types of games that are available.
1. Select the file titled “-CLICK THIS TO PLAY-.html” (can also be .htm) if it is in a folder, if it is just an HTML file such as “YourGameHere.html”, then double click it, and it will open in Chrome and run.

I have also included a list of game websites, however, these links are outdated due to the Replit purge on hosting, and websites ending with “Github.IO” are now being blocked. (Though some links do work.)

**Credits:**

All credit goes to the respective authors of each individual game, I take no credit nor do I accept any form of payment or retribution for these games, I have only created a space in which they can be more easily accessed. I have made no profit on this, nor will I ever.

**Final Words:**

I do quite enjoy finding these little bypasses in the systems, tearing at the little cracks and seams, and finding ways to erode them, it’s quite the fun pastime. If you know who I am, the creator, then I do ask you to keep that information private and out of the public ear and eye, for I like to keep my identity concealed due to the aggressive administration of the school district. I also highly encourage the spreading of The Archives and let the word be. I would also like to announce officially, “The Archives V3”! Expect it to be a lot better, And not web-based ;) so make sure you keep your eye open for that since it will include possibly a way to bypass any filtering on the internet (possibly). Until then, enjoy the Archives V2, and everything it has to offer to keep yourself entertained throughout the day. I hope you enjoy it, and please contact me if you experience any issues.

Thanks, TheGeneral01
